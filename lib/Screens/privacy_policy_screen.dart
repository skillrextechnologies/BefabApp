- Calories burned (active + resting): To assess user metabolism and wellness trends.
- Exercise minutes and activity duration: For mapping engagement in physical activities.
- Flights climbed: To evaluate physical effort and cardiovascular strain.
- Workouts logged (type/frequency/intensity): To compare activity modalities.
- VO₂ Max: Aerobic capacity used for fitness and endurance research.
- Heart rate zones, pace, splits: For performance and intensity analysis.
2. Body Measurements
- Weight, BMI, body fat %, lean mass, height, waist/hip circumference: For longitudinal studies on body composition and health indicators.
3. Heart and Cardiovascular Metrics

- ECG/EKG data: Cardiac function monitoring (requires explicit user device sharing).
4. Sleep Data
- Total sleep time, time in bed, sleep stages (light, deep, REM), sleep efficiency (%), bedtime/wake trends: Critical for studying rest quality and its effects on health markers.
